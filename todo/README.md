# TODO - Implementation Planning & Development Notes

This directory contains implementation plans, development notes, and work-in-progress documentation.

## 📋 Contents

### Implementation Planning

- **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Complete feature roadmap and technical design
  - Phase 1 (MVP): Core duplicate detection, review system, deletion pipeline ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**
  - Phase 2 (Advanced): Automation, smart detection, enhanced integrations 🚧 **PLANNED**
  - Phase 3 (Enterprise): Multi-user support, advanced analytics 💡 **FUTURE**
  - Database schema and architecture decisions
  - Technology stack justification

### Development Notes

- **[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Original project setup and initialization notes
  - Initial repository structure
  - Development setup instructions
  - Phase 1 development priorities
  - Historical context for the project

- **[FRONTEND_API_INTEGRATION.md](FRONTEND_API_INTEGRATION.md)** - Frontend-backend integration status

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder serves as a workspace for:

1. **Planning** - Feature roadmaps and implementation strategies
2. **Tracking** - What's been implemented vs. what's planned
3. **Context** - Historical decisions and rationale
4. **Reference** - Detailed technical specifications

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

Documents in this folder may:
- Move to `/docs` when they become user-facing documentation
- Be archived when features are fully implemented
- Be updated as implementation progresses
- Serve as reference for future development

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the complete feature matrix and roadmap.

## 🤝 For Contributors

If you're working on a new feature:

1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to see if it's already planned
2. Update the relevant section with your progress
3. Add implementation notes to `FRONTEND_API_INTEGRATION.md` if working on frontend
4. Create new markdown files here for complex features that need detailed planning
